To Build notEvilDime without GUI
---------------------

	cd src/
	make -f makefile.unix	USE_UPNP=-

See [readme-qt.md](readme-qt.md) for instructions on building notEvilDime-Qt, the graphical user interface.

Dependencies
---------------------

 Library     Purpose           Description
 -------     -------           -----------
 libssl      SSL Support       Secure communications
 libdb4.8    Berkeley DB       Blockchain & wallet storage
 libboost    Boost             C++ Library
 miniupnpc   UPnP Support      Optional firewall-jumping support

[miniupnpc](http://miniupnp.free.fr/) may be used for UPnP port mapping.  It can be downloaded from [here](
http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/).  UPnP support is compiled in and
turned off by default.  Set USE_UPNP to a different value to control this:

	USE_UPNP=-     No UPnP support miniupnp not required
	USE_UPNP=0    (the default) UPnP support turned off by default at runtime
	USE_UPNP=1    UPnP support turned on by default at runtime

IPv6 support may be disabled by setting:

	USE_IPV6=0    Disable IPv6 support

Licenses of statically linked libraries:
 Berkeley DB   New BSD license with additional requirement that linked
               software must be free open source
 Boost         MIT-like license
 miniupnpc     New (3-clause) BSD license


Dependency Build Instructions: Ubuntu & Debian
----------------------------------------------
Build requirements:

	sudo apt-get install build-essential
	sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

 db4.8 packages are available [here](https://launchpad.net/~notevildime/+archive/notevildime).

 Ubuntu precise has packages for libdb5.1-dev and libdb5.1++-dev,
 but using these will break binary wallet compatibility, and is not recommended.

for other Ubuntu & Debian:

	sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev
	sudo apt-get install libdb4.8++-dev
	sudo apt-get install libboost1.37-dev
 (If using Boost 1.37, append -mt to the boost libraries in the makefile)

Optional:

	sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev (see USE_UPNP compile flag)


Dependency Build Instructions: Gentoo
-------------------------------------

Note: If you just want to install notevildimed on Gentoo, you can add the notEvilDime overlay and use your package manager:

	layman -a notevildime && emerge notevildimed
	emerge -av1 --noreplace boost glib openssl sys-libs/db:4.8

Take the following steps to build (no UPnP support):

	cd ${BITCOIN_DIR}/src
	make -f makefile.unix USE_UPNP= USE_IPV6=1 BDB_INCLUDE_PATH='/usr/include/db4.8'
	strip notevildimed


Notes
-----
The release is built with GCC and then "strip notevildimed" to strip the debug
symbols, which reduces the executable size by about 90%.


miniupnpc
---------
	tar -xzvf miniupnpc-1.6.tar.gz
	cd miniupnpc-1.6
	make
	sudo su
	make install


Berkeley DB
-----------
You need Berkeley DB 4.8.  If you have to build Berkeley DB yourself:

	../dist/configure --enable-cxx
	make


Boost
-----
If you need to build Boost yourself:

	sudo su
	./bootstrap.sh
	./bjam install


Security
--------
To help make your notevildime installation more secure by making certain attacks impossible to
exploit even if a vulnerability is found, you can take the following measures:

* Position Independent Executable
    Build position independent code to take advantage of Address Space Layout Randomization
    offered by some kernels. An attacker who is able to cause execution of code at an arbitrary
    memory location is thwarted if he doesn't know where anything useful is located.
    The stack and heap are randomly located by default but this allows the code section to be
    randomly located as well.

    On an Amd64 processor where a library was not compiled with -fPIC, this will cause an error
    such as: "relocation R_X86_64_32 against `......' can not be used when making a shared object;"

    To build with PIE, use:

    	make -f makefile.unix ... -e PIE=1

    To test that you have built PIE executable, install scanelf, part of paxutils, and use:

    	scanelf -e ./notevildime

    The output should contain:
     TYPE
    ET_DYN

* Non-executable Stack
    If the stack is executable then trivial stack based buffer overflow exploits are possible if
    vulnerable buffers are found. By default, notevildime should be built with a non-executable stack
    but if one of the libraries it uses asks for an executable stack or someone makes a mistake
    and uses a compiler extension which requires an executable stack, it will silently build an
    executable without the non-executable stack protection.

    To verify that the stack is non-executable after compiling use:
    `scanelf -e ./notevildime`

    the output should contain:
	STK/REL/PTL
	RW- R-- RW-

    The STK RW- means that the stack is readable and writeable but not executable.
